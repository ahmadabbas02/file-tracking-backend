# EMU File Tracker API

The main purpose of this project was to make it simple for users (Students,Advisor, Secretary, Chairman, Admin) to follow up with student documents and application forms all in one place. This is done by digitalizing the process and reducing paperwork needed. Students will be able to upload documents and fill in forms directly to the system and then the responsible people will be able to approve/deny it all done in one step. Other actors will be able to see studentsâ€™ documents uploaded to the system.
